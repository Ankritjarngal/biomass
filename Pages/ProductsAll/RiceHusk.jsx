      description="Paddy Husk is the hard protective covering of rice grains that is separated during milling. It is a readily available agricultural by-product widely used as a biomass fuel. With moderate calorific value and low moisture content, rice husk serves as an efficient and economical energy source for rural and semi-urban industries. Its abundant availability and renewable nature make it an eco-friendly substitute for conventional fuels in boilers and gasifiers."
